Through the course I was able to strengthen my skills by applying the programming codes in each of the cases developed. Likewise, I was able to discover which are my areas of opportunity when using programming tools as in the case of Pandas in Google Colab. 
Likewise, I was able to learn how programming is useful in the working world; the codes, as it was with linear programming for problem solving to make decisions related to maximization or minimization in companies and forecasting methods used to predict future value or estimate trends in company databases.
Finally I consider that even though programming is not my best skill, I enjoyed learning it, always supported by my classmates and professor who was always attentive to each one of the students.
